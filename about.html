        <h1>Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          Real estate shapes our world at every turn, leaving a legacy beyond simply bricks and sticks.  
          We believe that thoughtful, sustainable assets can add significant value to our communities.  
          And while prudent business decisions are a foundation of our venture, we commit to an artistry and craft that produces unique spaces and positive 
          social impact, in addition to outsized investment returns.  
        </p>
        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>
          We are progressive, opportunistic investors who think globally and act locally.  
          We identify special situations and operating inefficiencies that allow us to go where others may not.  
          We are empirical and skeptical, using research and data while rigorously challenging assumptions and consensus. 
        </p>
