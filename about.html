        <h1>Philosophy / Outlook</h1>
        <p>
           
          Real estate shapes our world at every turn, leaving a footprint beyond simply bricks and sticks.  
          We believe that responsible, sustainable, well-balanced projects can make all the difference in our communities.  
          And while prudent business decisions are a foundation of our venture, we commit to an artistry and craft that produces unique spaces and positive 
          social impact, in addition to outsized investment returns.  
        </p>
        <h1>Thesis / Strategy</h1>
        <p>
           
          We are opportunistic investors who seek out assets at a discount
          to their long-run values.  We identify special situations and 
          operating inefficiencies that allow us to get creative and push the envelope.  We are research-based, using 
          technology and data to be rigorous and nimble. 
        </p>
        <p>These are the types of opportunities we target:
