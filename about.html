        <h1>Philosophy / Outlook</h1>
        <p>
           
          Real estate influences peoples' quality of life at every turn.  
          We believe that responsible, well-balanced projects and thoughtfully 
          managed properties can make all the difference in our communities.  
          And while prudent business decisions are a foundation of our venture, 
          our philosophy is that thoughtful planning can generate both positive 
          social impact and outsized investment returns.  
        </p>
        <h1>Thesis / Strategy</h1>
        <p>
           
          We are opportunistic investors who purchase assets at a reasonable discount
          to their long-run intrinsic values.  We identify special situations and 
          operating inefficiencies that allow us to get creative.  We leverage 
          technology and data to be nimble and quick, creating an edge over competitors. 
        </p>
